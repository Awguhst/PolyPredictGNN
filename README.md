# Polymer Property and Solubility Prediction Demo

This app provides a simple interface to demonstrate two advanced models for predicting **polymer properties** and **solubility** using **SMILES representations**. The app showcases the following models:

- **HybridGNN** ‚Äì Predicts **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)** and **Melting Temperature (Tm)** for polymers.

- **SolubilityGNN** ‚Äì Estimates **polymer solubility** in various solvents.

Both models utilize **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to analyze molecular structures as graphs, combining them with physicochemical descriptors to improve prediction accuracy.

## Motivation

The ability to predict polymer properties and solubility is crucial for material design in various industries, including **packaging**, **electronics**, and **aerospace**. Traditional experimental methods are often resource intensive and time consuming. This framework offers a **data-driven, scalable alternative**, providing real-time predictions for:

- **Thermal Properties**: Glass Transition Temperature (Tg) and Melting Temperature (Tm).
- **Solubility**: Polymer solubility in different solvents, helping with solvent selection for specific applications.

By leveraging modern **graph-based deep learning** techniques, the framework bridges the gap between molecular structure and practical material design.

## Streamlit App Interface

- **User Input:**
   - The user inputs a **polymer SMILES** string and an optional **solvent SMILES** string.

- **Prediction Process:**
   - The app checks if the **SMILES** strings are valid.
   - If valid, it predicts the **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)** and **Melting Temperature (Tm)** of the polymer.

- **Polymer and Solvent Visualization:**
   - 2D molecular images of the **polymer** and **solvent** (if provided) are displayed.

- **Solubility Prediction:**
   - If a solvent is provided, the app predicts the **solubility** of the polymer in the solvent as a percentage.

- **Similar Monomers, Solvents, and Results Display:**
   - The app recommends **top similar monomers** and **top alternative solvents** based on predicted solubility.
   - It also shows the predicted **thermal properties (Tg, Tm)** and **solubility results** alongside the 2D images of the polymer and solvent.

## Model Architecture

### HybridGNN (Polymer Property Prediction)
**HybridGNN** predicts the **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)** and **Melting Temperature (Tm)** of polymers using both molecular graph representation and physicochemical descriptors through **multi-target regression**.

- **GIN**: Extracts structural features from the polymer graph, capturing atom and bond interactions.
- **GAT**: Assigns attention weights to graph nodes, focusing on important features for complex molecular structures.
- **GraphConv**: Processes molecular graph data, capturing higher-level structural features.
- **PCA**: Reduces dimensionality of descriptors, improving model efficiency while retaining key chemical information.
- **Fully connected layers**: Combine graph embeddings and descriptor vectors for enhanced prediction.

**Multi-target Regression**: Predicts both **Tg** and **Tm** simultaneously, optimizing the process for both properties.

### SolubilityGNN (Polymer Solubility Prediction)
**SolubilityGNN** predicts polymer solubility in a given solvent, considering polymer-solvent interactions with **dual SMILES inputs** (polymer and solvent).

- **TransformerConv**: Models molecular interactions by considering both node and edge features.
- **GINConv**: Extracts higher-level molecular patterns from polymer and solvent graphs.
- **Edge Features**: Uses both atom (node) and bond (edge) features to better capture solubility dynamics.
- **Fully connected layers**: Combines graph features with molecular descriptors, utilizing **GELU activations** and dropout to prevent overfitting.

**Dual SMILES Inputs**: Takes separate SMILES strings for the polymer and solvent, predicting the polymer's solubility in the solvent.

Both models use **GNN-based architectures** with enhancements tailored to predict thermal properties (Tg, Tm) and solubility, combining graph embeddings with molecular descriptors for accurate predictions.

## Datasets

### Polymer Property Dataset
The **Polymer Property Dataset** contains **1,564** samples, each consisting of a **monomer SMILES** string along with corresponding **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)** and **Melting Temperature (Tm)** values for the polymer. This dataset is used to train the **HybridGNN** model for predicting the thermal properties of polymers based on their molecular structure.

### Polymer Solubility Dataset
The **Polymer Solubility Dataset** includes **1,819** pairs of **monomer SMILES** and **solvent SMILES** strings. Each entry is labeled with a binary column indicating whether the polymer is **soluble** in the corresponding solvent. This dataset is utilized to train the **SolubilityGNN** model for predicting polymer-solvent solubility interactions.

Both datasets were sourced from **peer-reviewed papers**.
